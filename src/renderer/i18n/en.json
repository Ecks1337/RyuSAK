This translation process is time consuming and you'll notice it in two ways:<br /><br />- Any new shaders that are encountered will cause the emulation to pause until the translation is done, which causes stuttering and FPS drops. When you load a game for the first time a lot of translation will happen. By playing more this stuttering decreases rapidly.<br /><br />- The emulator will save any shaders a game uses (AKA it caches them). When you launch a game, the emulator will take some time loading saved shaders, to prevent the stuttering from happening again.",
